# Riemann-Sum
A Java program that takes user input of an algebraic expression, as well as several parameters, to calculate the Riemann sum.  By requesting a large number of iterations, the user can use this program to calculate an accurate definite integral.

This project was completed for my 11th grade end-of-year calculus project.
